Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, and early
detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. With the advent of machine
learning, automated breast cancer diagnosis has gained significant attention, leveraging
computational models to improve diagnostic accuracy. This study focuses on the King
Abdulaziz University Hospital Breast Cancer Mammography Dataset (KAUH-BCMD), a
comprehensive dataset offering real-world mammographic images labeled by expert
radiologists. We implement pre-processing techniques (noise reduction, contrast
enhancement, and ROI extraction), feature engineering, and multiple classifiers (Decision
Trees, KNN, Na¨ıve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM with linear and non-linear
kernels). Feature selection using SelectKBest and dimensionality reduction via PCA
enhance model efficiency. Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
and AUC-ROC, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation ensuring robust
performance. Our results demonstrate competitive accuracy, up to 90.5% with SVM,
highlighting the importance of region-specific datasets for culturally relevant diagnostics
